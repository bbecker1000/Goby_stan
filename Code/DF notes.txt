DF Notes 2024-01-26

1. east zone get most detritus and subsequent low DO
so look at different slopes by zone for wind

2. consider adding the tub_algae
    check completeness of data
    can increase DO, but also reduces DO with dieoff.
    
3. BreachDays and GAMM ### BB MADE QUADRATIC
    A. DF says yes
    Reach Lafferty Goby papers that show dispersal part of flushing.
    if zero breach days, then detritus and nutrients pooling
    if many breach days, gobies can be lost to velocity and flush out of system
    last summer was first time with gobies at Muir Beach and was related to wettest year.  came from Rodeo?
    
    B. Also smooth rain  
    possibly smooth wind...pushes detritus to edge, BUT ALSO wind increases DO.
    
    C. Get UCB langmuir cells and DO levels.  DF send paper to BB.
    
4. Google earth color photos?  Summer before we sample?
      greenness of lagoon as phytoplankton proxy.
      Maybe a future project??
      
5. Breed year round so no lag effects from previous year environmental variables.
      quick population level response time
      
6. paper on gobies and other estuarine fishes  found SB and Goby linkages...  DF send along to BB
